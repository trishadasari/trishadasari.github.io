                    <h1>About the Parietal Lobe</h1>
                    <p>The Parietal Lobe distinguishes input and output from your five senses, sight, smell, touch,
                        taste, and hearing. It is located diagonally towards the Occipital Lobe and right above the
                        Temporal Lobe. According to, “https://www.spinalcord.com/parietal-lobe” , it states that “The
                        parietal lobe is located just under the parietal bone of the skull. This important brain lobe
                        helps integrate sensory input and process language.” The Parietal Lobe works with the Occipital
                        Lobe over visual control. Like pilots in planes navigating through the skies but in this case it
                        is the humans surroundings. Your senses are used daily but blue light can affect them by
                        buffering in tasks that you normally do and coordinates with the other lobes at a very fast
                        speed. The Parietal Lobe receives data from your surroundings even while you are sleeping. </p>
