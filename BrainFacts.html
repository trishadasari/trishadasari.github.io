                    <h1>Fact #5:</h1>
                    <p>Every time you recall a memory or have a new thought, you create a connection in the brain.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Fact #6:</h1>
                    <p> The harder you think, the more oxygen and fuel your brain will use from your blood – up to 50
                        percent.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Fact #7:</h1>
                    <p>The human brain is about 75% water.

                    <h1>Fact #8:</h1>
                    <p> More electrical impulses are generated in one day by a single human brain than by all the
                        telephones in the world.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Fact #9:</h1>
                    <p> Your brain consumes about 25 watts of power while you’re awake – enough energy to illuminate a
                        lightbulb!
                    </p>
                    <h1>Fact #10:</h1>
                    <p>70,000 is the number of thoughts estimated that the human brain produces on an average day.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Fact #11:</h1>
                    <p>The brain can’t feel any sort of pain. </p>
                    <h1>Fact #12:</h1>
                    <p> Cholesterol is key to learning and memory. However, high cholesterol has different effects
                        depending on your age and other factors.

                    <h1>Fact #13:</h1>
                    <p>Headaches are caused by a chemical reaction in your brain combined with the muscles and nerves of
                        your neck and head.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Fact #14:</h1>
                    <p>The human brain will grow three times its size in the first year of life. It continues to grow
                        until you’re about 18 years old.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Fact #15:</h1>
                    <p>The human brain gets smaller as we get older. This usually happens sometime after middle age.
