                    <h1>Intro : What is the brain?</h1>
                    <p> The brain is the most complex organ in your body, and there are tons of sections in the brain
                        matter assigned
                        to a specific task. Think of it like making a car, one person works on the physical structure,
                        another
                        develops the idea, and the last processes the information. Without one the other won’t be able
                        to function
                        on a certain task without each other. There are multiple parts of the brain such as the parietal
                        lobe,
                        temporal lobe, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, cerebellum, and brain stem. Each piece corresponds
                        to another
                        working together to perform simple tasks and activities in your daily life.
                    </p>

                    <h1>How are electronincs infused with your daily life?</h1>
                    <p>Today, using electronics is a big part of our daily lives, some people think they can’t live
                        without them.
                        Although, people love electronics especially ones with screens such as phones, ipads, laptops,
                        and more.
                        These days we have electric toothbrushes and glasses with cameras in them changing the way
                        people perceive
                        the world drastically. With advanced technology at their hand their brains start to adapt to
                        relying on
                        these items to perform everyday tasks. Even though some devices do not emit blue light, a
                        majority of
                        electronics people need to rely on for jobs,schools, and personal uses do. These devices can
                        affect the
                        brain in a negative way. Electronics are needed to be used to make life easier but, overusing
                        them can be a
                        big problem entirely. For example,electronics can physically strain your eyes and body, leading
                        to permanent
                        damage such as blurry vision.
