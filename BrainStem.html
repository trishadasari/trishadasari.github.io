                    <h1>About the Brain Stem</h1>
                    <p>The brainstem is located at the bottom of the brain and is connected to your spinal cord at the
                        top. The brainstem is one of the most vital needs for a human to survive. It is broken down into
                        3 parts starting from the top, the midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata. According to,
                        “https://www.physio-pedia.com/Brainstem” , “It is responsible for many vital functions of life,
                        such as breathing, consciousness, blood pressure, heart rate, and sleep.” The brain stem also
                        carries information from your nerves up to the brain through the spinal cord. Blue light may not
                        affect it, but electronics will .Electronics need to be operated in some way which you may need
                        to use your hands for. Your hands can bear severe pain after and overuse of clicking buttons
                        nonstop. The most commonly known one is, arthritis causing severe pain to your nerves linking
                        with the Parietal Lobe for its senses.
