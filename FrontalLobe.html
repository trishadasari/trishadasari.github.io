                    <h1>About the Frontal Lobe</h1>
                    <p>The Frontal Lobes are located at the front of the brain living up to its name. They are the
                        largest lobes and are associated with movement, expressing language and complex level functions.
                        Emotions and behavior is als linked to the Frontal Lobes. According to,” Queensland Health”,
                        "The frontal lobes are considered our behavior and emotional control center and home to our
                        personality.” Using electronics continuously affects this part of the brain with changes in your
                        personality, behavior, and multi-step movements. This can cause you to be more introverted and
                        hostile with 0 to no motivation in activities you once enjoyed.</p>
